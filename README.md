## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Technical documentation for hardware products—especially in the FPV and embedded-systems world—is often scattered, inconsistently formatted, and challenging to analyze in bulk.
This archive aims to solve that by offering:

- 🗃️ **A centralized, organized collection** of Orqa FPV manuals, specs, guides, and support information
- 🧠 **Educational value** for students and learners studying electronics, optics, radio systems, firmware, and documentation writing
- 🤖 **Reliable training data** for machine learning tasks such as:
  - Text classification
  - Summarization and rewriting
  - Retrieval-augmented generation
  - Technical reasoning and comprehension models
- 🔧 **A reproducible dataset** for developers, researchers, and analysts who need structured, consistent, real-world documentation

This repository **does not claim ownership** of Orqa’s original materials.
